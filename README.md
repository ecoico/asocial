# Asocial

**Being ordinary is the value, not the exception.**

Asocial is a social web app designed as the antithesis of Instagram and performative social media. It celebrates the mundane, the banal, and the unremarkable moments of everyday life.

## Philosophy

Modern social media has created a culture of curation, comparison, and performance. Every post is optimized for engagement, every photo filtered to perfection, every moment crafted to project success.

Asocial rejects this entirely.

Here, the goal is to share the ordinary:
- Your coffee getting cold
- Waiting for a late bus
- Folding mismatched socks
- Staring at your ceiling
- The weather being "fine"

No ostentation. No competition. No success metrics. Just... existence.

## Anti-Features

What we deliberately **don't** have:

- ❌ **No public likes** - Your worth isn't measured in hearts
- ❌ **No follower counts** - No social hierarchy
- ❌ **No algorithm** - Chronological feed only
- ❌ **No photo filters** - Reality, not perfection
- ❌ **No engagement metrics** - No "top posts" or "trending"
- ❌ **No external sharing** - This isn't for bragging elsewhere
- ❌ **No dopamine notifications** - No red badges demanding attention
- ❌ **No emoji reactions** - Just simple text comments

## Features

What we **do** have:

- ✅ **Chronological feed** - Newest first, no manipulation
- ✅ **Short posts** - 280 characters of unfiltered thoughts
- ✅ **Optional images** - One photo, unedited, if you want
- ✅ **Private bookmarks** - Save posts for yourself only
- ✅ **Simple comments** - Text only, genuine responses
- ✅ **Minimal profiles** - Username, optional bio (80 chars max), that's it

## Design Principles

### Visual Aesthetic
- **Pastel color palette**: Soft, muted tones that don't demand attention
- **Ample whitespace**: Breathing room instead of visual noise
- **Clean typography**: Readable Inter font, nothing flashy
- **Subtle animations**: Gentle fades, not jarring transitions
- **No gradients or neon**: Flat, honest design

### User Experience
- **Anti-aspirational placeholders**: "What uninteresting thing are you doing?"
- **No gamification**: No streaks, badges, or achievement systems
- **Quiet interface**: No bright red notifications or urgent calls-to-action
- **Deliberate friction**: No infinite scroll (future consideration)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No build tools required - this is vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. That's it. No npm install, no build step, no complexity.

### Usage

**Creating a post:**
1. Type your mundane thought in the text box
2. Optionally attach a single, unedited image
3. Click "Post"
4. Your ordinary moment is now shared

**Interacting with posts:**
- Click the ☆ to privately bookmark (only you see this)
- Click the 💬 to read/write simple text comments
- Click a username to view their profile

**Your profile:**
- Shows your posts in chronological order
- No statistics, no follower count, no performance metrics
- Just your username, optional bio, and your posts

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic, accessible structure
- **CSS3** - Custom properties, flexbox, subtle animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, no dependencies
- **LocalStorage** - Simple client-side persistence

## Philosophy in Practice

### Why no likes?
Because your worth isn't measured in hearts. A post about cold coffee is just as valid as any other post.

### Why chronological feed?
Algorithms promote "engaging" content, which encourages performative posting. Chronological order treats all moments equally.

### Why no follower counts?
Social hierarchy creates pressure to perform. Here, everyone's voice has equal weight.

### Why such muted colors?
Bright, saturated colors demand attention and create urgency. Pastels are calm, neutral, and don't compete for your dopamine.

### Why no infinite scroll?
(Future consideration) Deliberate endpoints encourage intentional usage, not mindless consumption.

## Customization

Feel free to modify:
- **Color palette** - Update CSS variables in `styles.css`
- **Character limits** - Change max lengths in HTML and JS
- **Mock data** - Edit `js/data.js` to add your own mundane posts
- **User profile** - Change `CURRENT_USER` in `js/data.js`

## Future Considerations

Potential features that maintain the anti-aspirational philosophy:
- Random posting times to discourage "optimal" posting strategies
- Auto-delete after 30 days to embrace impermanence
- "Boring score" that awards less exciting posts
- Deliberately slow loading to discourage addiction

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, ask yourself: "Does this make the app more or less performative?"

If it adds any form of gamification, metrics, or social competition, it doesn't belong here.

## License

This is a concept project. Use it, modify it, make it your own. Just keep it ordinary.

**Remember**: Your ordinary life is enough. You don't need to be aspirational. You're already interesting just by existing.

Welcome to Asocial. Where being mundane is the entire point.
